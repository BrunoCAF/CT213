# Intro to Machine Learning: Color Segmentation through Neural Networks

This project is a first experiment with Machine Learning techniques. The problem to be solved is that of Color Segmentation for Robot Soccer. The whole machinery of the neural network was coded directly, with no aid from machine learning frameworks.
