# Population Based Methods: Particle Swarm Optimisation

This project continues to explore optimisation algorithms, this time with a population based method, namely the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm.

The problem explored here is that of finding the optimal gains of a PID controller for a Line Following Robot.
