# Evolutionary Strategies

This project is another one on optimisation algorithms, but this time I employ evolutionary strategies to find the extrema of functions. 

The goal is to implement a simple evolutionary strategy to compare it to the CMA-ES on several functions used as benchmarks for optimisation algorithms.
