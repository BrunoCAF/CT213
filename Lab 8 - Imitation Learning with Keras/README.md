# Intro to Deep Learning: Imitation Learning with Keras

This project is a first experiment with Deep Learning techniques, and it deals with the technique known as Imitation Learning. The problem here is to "imitate" the walking movement of a humanoid robot, by observing the evolution of the angles and positions of some of its parts during its movement, and then training a neural network to copy this movement. 

To design all the architecture of the neural network I used the Deep Learning framework Keras.
