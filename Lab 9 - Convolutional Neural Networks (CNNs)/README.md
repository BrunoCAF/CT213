# Convolutional Neural Networks

The purpose of this project is to implement, train and test the Convolutional Neural Network LeNet5, for Natural Language Processing, on the MNIST dataset, which consists of hand-written decimal digits which the neural network aims to recognize. The implementation of the layers of the NN was done through the framework Keras.
