# Informed Search: Dijkstra, Greedy Search and A*

This project approaches the problem of Path Planning for a mobile robot on a 8-connected grid. The goal is to solve this problem through different searching techniques, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, a greedy search, and the A* algorithm, and to later compare their performances in terms of time complexity, and of quality of the path found.
