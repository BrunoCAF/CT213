# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Solving a Markov Decision Process through Dynamic Programming

In this project I studied and implemented model-based RL algorithms in the context of a known MDP, namely policy evaluation, policy iteration and value iteration, with the goal of finding optimal policies to a grid world problem.
